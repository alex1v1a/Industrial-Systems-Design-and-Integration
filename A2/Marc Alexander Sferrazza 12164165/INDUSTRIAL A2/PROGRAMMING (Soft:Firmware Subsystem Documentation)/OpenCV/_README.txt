There are 3 OpenCV programs included in this document, the functions and their purpose can be found in more detail in each corresponding folder.

Within each Assignment folder is
	- Description (What the task is to be preformed and the objectives the code must meet)
	- Report (A detailed overview of the running code and what it is set out to achieve, how it goal is achieved and so on)
	- Code (For assignments 1 & 2 made with OpenCV in Visual Studio, and Assignment 3 from source on Mac Terminal)
	- Resource Images (images that are used in the assignment and what it is to be detected e.g colour tennis balls, shapes and so on)
	- Latex (The source folder containing the report resources)
	
The resource folder in this directory was used in the project as a reference and is all the containing elements that are referred to in the report with the links provided as reference also
